	PresetName = Eleann Forest
	Description = The site known as Eleann Forest was once a lush paradise, filled with vibrant flora and many types of interesting crabs. This paradise was lost early during the planet's exploitation, when an intrepid mining company utilised "controlled defoliation techniques" to facilitate easier mining access. The company has since moved on, and nature has started to reclaim the area, if only a little.
