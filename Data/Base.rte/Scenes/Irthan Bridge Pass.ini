	PresetName = Irthan Bridge Pass
	Description = This bridge is named for the fugitive who discovered the planet, John Irthan. While fleeing from OSA authorities, his flight computer malfunctioned and he flew straight at the previously-uncharted planet. To this day he's commemorated as the planet's first pioneer, even though he landed a little too hard.
