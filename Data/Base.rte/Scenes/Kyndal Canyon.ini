AddScene = Scene
	PresetName = Kyndal Canyon
	Description = One of the most easily recognisable sights on this planet, early archaeological studies suggested that the T-shaped rock may have been artifically placed by someone or something thousands of years ago. Unfortunately, studies of the area have ceased, as the gold in this canyon makes it a hotly contested area.
