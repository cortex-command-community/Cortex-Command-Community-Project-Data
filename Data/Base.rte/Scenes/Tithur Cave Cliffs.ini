	PresetName = Tithur Cave Cliffs
	Description = These cliffs are named after the now-defunct Tithur Extraction Initiative - an upstart company that made unfavourable mining agreements with several of the larger corporations. Before they could prove whether their business model was viable, a freak accident with a small nuclear device caused the destruction of their headquarters, and the company never recovered.
