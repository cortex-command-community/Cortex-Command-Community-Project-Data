AddScene = Scene
	PresetName = Treadur Forest
	Description = Early land surveys show that there was once a forest here, but the land has long since been cleared for mining. Now this area is notable for the fragmented network of caves below the surface; they provide easy access to gold, but are an awful foundation for building bunkers, making the spot hard to fortify.
