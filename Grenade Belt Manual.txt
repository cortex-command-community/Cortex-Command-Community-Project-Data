How to create a grenade belt:
	Requirements: A predefined TDExplosive/ThrownDevice, in other words the grenade you want the belt to have.
	
	1º: You have to define a greande belt item in ini as an TDExplosive/ThrownDevice.
		Preferably below the previous grenade, and preferably named something like " 'Grenade name' Belt "
		
			-The quickest way to do so is to just copy the ini of the actual grenade and remove any lua scripts it may have
			
			-OPTIONAL: You can also remove stuff like explosion gibs (smoke, etc), and gib sounds of that nature.
	
	2º: Give it the script "Base.rte/Devices/Shared/Scripts/GrenadeBelt.lua"
	
	3º: Give it this list of CustomNumberValues in the ini:
	
		AddCustomValue = StringValue
			Grenade Name = Frag Grenade
		AddCustomValue = StringValue
			Grenade Tech = Coalition.rte
		AddCustomValue = NumberValue
			Grenade Count = 3
		AddCustomValue = NumberValue
			Replenish Rate = 0
		AddCustomValue = NumberValue
			Belt Mass = 1.5
			
		-WARNING: if your device is a ThrownDevice instead of a TDExplosive, then you must also input this custom value:
		
		AddCustomValue = NumberValue
			Thrown Device = 1
	
	4º Modify said values:
		-Grenade Name: The name of the predefined TDExplosive/ThrownDevice you want the belt to use
		-Grenade Tech: From what tech the grenade is from
		-Grenade Count: How many greandes come per belt
		-Replenish Rate: How long, in ms, does the belt take before replenishing the grenade
		-Belt Mass: The starting weight of the belt that will be attached to the actor
	
	5º Modify the belt item's mass and goldprice (IMPORTANT):
		-The mass of the belt item should be defined as: Mass = Belt Mass + (Grenade Mass * Grenade Count)
			-Grenade mass is the mass of the TDExplosive/ThrownDevice the belt is going to use
			-EXAMPLE:
				AddCustomValue = NumberValue
					Belt Mass = 2
				AddCustomValue = NumberValue
					Grenade Count = 3
					
				The mass of an individual grenade is 1.5
				
				The mass of the belt item should then be: 2 + (1.5*3) = 6.5
		
		-The gold price of the belt item should be defined as: GoldValue = Grenade Value * Grenade Count
			-EXAMPLE: A grenade cost 10 oz and its belt has 3 grenades. The belt should then cost 30 oz
	
	6º: Make the actual grenade non-buyable with the ini property "Buyable = 0".
		-Make sure to replace them in your loadouts for their belt counterparts
	
	7º(OPTIONAL): Give it an icon like those of vanilla with the number of greandes in the belt
	
	8º(OPTIONAL): Write in the desc the replenish rate and belt mass stats like in vanilla
