	PresetName = M1 - Fredeleig Plains
	Description = The area is mostly flat and the terrain is easy to dig in, but little gold is found here. The name is a corruption of the Norwegian word "fredelig" (meaning "peaceful"), and was given to the area by a passing Ronin group who are often referred to as the "Space Vikings" for their mostly Nordic ancestry. The area is notable for its distinct lack of wildlife and its mild, temperate weather.
