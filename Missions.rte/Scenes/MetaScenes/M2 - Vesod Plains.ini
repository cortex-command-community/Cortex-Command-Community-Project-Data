	Description = Grassy hills with some patches of sand along the terrain. The name, Vesod, is a S'vaari word for "hills," used specifically in religious contexts. After Earth's near destruction at the hands of a spiritual leader in the days before space travel, many people were left embittered with religion as a whole. As a result, S'vaari spirituality, which worships only the beauty of nature, was adopted by many people in the years following first contact.
