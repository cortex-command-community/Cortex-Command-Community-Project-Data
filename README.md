# Cortex Command Community Project
This is where you can find the community's plans for Cortex Command's future. There'll be new sprites, rebalancing, new weapons and units and more. Stay up to date in our [discord channel](https://discord.gg/SdNnKJN).

# How To Make Your Voice Heard #

So you want to take part in the glorious project? A good start would be going to the discord where the project is hosted. You can find a link [here](https://discord.gg/SdNnKJN). After that, all our releases will be available under the releases area and all of our bugs and changes and ideas are tracked in github issues. Feel free to play and suggest changes or point out any problems.

# How To Make Issues #

If you're familiar with github you should be familiar with making issues. It's as simple as going to the issues tab and clicking a button. Once you do that, you'll see an easy to follow template to fill in. After you've done that, try to put in the appropriate category for the issue and it'll be handled from there.

# How to Contribute #

If you've got experience with the game's ini data through modding it, are good at spriting or know lua, maybe you can contribute some of your time directly to the project. We'll look at any pull requests that come in and are always happy to have more hands on deck.
If you're an experienced programmer (particularly with C++), there's also tons of work to be done in our [source](https://github.com/cortex-command-community/Cortex-Command-Community-Project-Source) repository.
