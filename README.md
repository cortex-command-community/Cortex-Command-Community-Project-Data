So you want to take part in the project? A good start would be going to the discord where the project is discussed. You can find a link [here](https://discord.gg/TSU6StNQUG). After that, all our releases will be available under the releases area and all of our bugs and changes and ideas are tracked in github issues.

# How To Make Issues

If you're familiar with github you should be familiar with making issues. It's as simple as going to the issues tab and clicking a button. Once you do that, you'll see an easy to follow template to fill in. After you've done that, try to put in the appropriate category for the issue and it'll be handled from there.

# How to Contribute

If you've got experience with the game's ini data through modding it, are good at spriting or know Lua, maybe you can contribute some of your time directly to the project. We'll look at any pull requests that come in and are always happy to have more hands on deck.
If you're an experienced programmer (particularly with C++), there's also tons of work to be done in our [source](https://github.com/cortex-command-community/Cortex-Command-Community-Project-Source) repository.
